<p class="para">The above images were taken during evening activities. For evening activities, students are given several choices for activities to participate in, 
and students must give their top three picks out of the given options. The next day, each student will be placed in one of the activities based on their
choices from the previous night. There is a different selection of activities every day. The shown images were from some of the first day's activities, including "Project Runway," 
in which someone would get in a trash bag to have people decorate it to participate in a fashion show of sorts, as well as "Cookie Decorating," where students could decorate 
cookies and also color sheets because they would have run out of cookies otherwise, and "Pop Culture Jeopardy," where students could play 
Jeopardy, presumably with questions relating various pop culture things.</p>
